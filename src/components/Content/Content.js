        React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with React.Component subclasses:
        </Card.Text>
        <Button variant="success">Read more</Button>
      </Card.Body>
    </Card>
          <Card className="text-center mt-3">
      <Card.Body>
        <Card.Title>What Is React?</Card.Title>
